# Merger Train

Images and example code from [Wilkinson et al. (submitted)]() for the purposes of training models to detect mergers and non-mergers. Within this repository are random forest and LDA models trained on SKIRT images of mergers and non-mergers from IllustrisTNG100-1, as well as the necessary data to train your own.

<!-- DESCRIPTION OF DATA -->
## Description of Data

There are four directories in this repository. What follows is a brief description of the contents of each.

- Photometry contains the r-band photometry generated by the SKIRT pipeline, before any realism is applied. Native to the SKIRT pipeline, the images have a resolution of pixel scale of 0.1 kpc / pix and are redshifted according to a fixed redshift of z = 0.1.

- Idealized contains the images rebinned to match the degraded images, but without PSF blurring and minimal sky noise. 

- Degraded contains the images degraded to various image qualities. The image quality can be drawn directly from the file name.

- Examples contains a demonstration of how to use the data to train a model to detect galaxy mergers.
